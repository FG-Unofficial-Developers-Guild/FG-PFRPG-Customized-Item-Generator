	<string name="desc_bmos_createconsumable_wand"><p>A wand is a thin baton that contains a single spell of 4th level or lower. A wand has 50 charges when created—each charge allows the use of the wand’s spell one time. A wand that runs out of charges is just a stick.</p></string>
	<string name="desc_bmos_createconsumable_scroll"><p>A scroll is a spell (or collection of spells) that has been stored in written form. A spell on a scroll can be used only once. The writing vanishes from the scroll when the spell is activated. Using a scroll is basically like casting a spell.</p></string>
	<string name="desc_bmos_createconsumable_potion"><p>A potion is a magic liquid that produces its effect when imbibed. Potions vary incredibly in appearance. Magic oils are similar to potions, except that oils are applied externally rather than imbibed. A potion or oil can be used only once. It can duplicate the effect of a spell of up to 3rd level that has a casting time of less than 1 minute and targets one or more creatures or objects.</p></string>
