# Customized Item Generator
This extension allows you to add enhancement bonuses, special qualities, and special materials to (and change the side of) weapons and armor.

It also supports creation of wands, scrolls, and potions.

If you use [Advanced Effects](https://forge.fantasygrounds.com/shop/items/33/view), some additional effects will be auto-added to newly created weapons such as Holy.
