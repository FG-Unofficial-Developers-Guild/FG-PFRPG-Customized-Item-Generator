The majority of blight quartz deposits are no larger than the size of a human fist. The process of crystallization diffuses the negative energy inherent in the material somewhat, but in large quantities the stuff can be debilitating. As long as a creature carries a pound or more of blight quartz or is within 5 feet of a deposit of blight quartz of a minimum of 10 pounds, that creature incurs 1 negative level.

This negative level never results in actual level loss, but cannot be overcome in any way (including via restoration) while proximity to the quartz continues. This is a negative energy effect. While blight quartz cannot be worked into armor, the material can be used to augment melee weapons, as well as arrowheads, spear tips, and similar ammunition. Doing so costs an additional 200 gp per piece of ammunition or an additional 2,500 gp for a weapon. A creature hit with a blight quartz weapon must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1 negative level.

Throneglass is a special material as strong as steel that also provides the bearer with protection against an opponent’s psychic abilities.

		sAddDescription = "<p><b>Source: The Dragon's Demand pg. 35</b></p><p>Grioths wield weapons fashioned from a strange sort of transparent material called voidglass. This material is as hard as steel, but made of crystals that voidglass shapers on unknown worlds grow into the desired shapes. Voidglass resonates with a creature’s mind, bolstering thought and mental defenses. Any suit of armor normally made from metal can be made of voidglass. A suit of light voidglass armor grants a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting magic. This bonus increases to +2 for medium voidglass armor, and +3 for heavy voidglass armor. Voidglass armor isn’t often worn by grioths, but voidglass weapons are another story. The creatures (and perhaps other strange beings with similar psychic capabilities) can funnel violent bursts of psychic energy through these weapons on a hit. In the hands of any creature, a voidglass piercing or slashing weapon deals 1 additional damage on a hit—bludgeoning weapons gain no benefit. Voidglass has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A pound of raw, unworked voidglass is worth 100 gp.</p>",

When a weapon constructed of wyroot confirms a critical hit, it absorbs some of the life force of the creature hit. The creature hit is unharmed and the wyroot weapon gains 1 life point. As a swift action, a wielder with a ki pool or an arcane pool can absorb 1 life point from the wyrwood weapon and convert it into either 1 ki point or 1 arcane pool point. A wyroot weapon can gain at most 1 life point per day and hold up to 1 life point at a time. More powerful wyroot weapons can gain up to 3 life points per day and hold up to 3 life points at a time. Any unspent life points dissipate at dusk. A creature can convert life points from only one wyroot weapon per day. Wyroot can be used to construct any melee weapon made entirely of wood or with a wooden haft. Constructing a weapon that can hold 1 life point increases the cost by 1,000 gp, constructing one that can hold up to 2 life points increases the cost by 2,000 gp, and constructing one that can hold up to 3 life points increases the cost by 4,000 gp.</p>',
